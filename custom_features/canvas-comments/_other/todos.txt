be able to stretch the menu
show what percent of pages have been checked
keep track of if you've seen a comment
see unread comments
comments on moduels page link to that page
telegraph that things are loading (projects, todos, comments)
highlight pieces of the page and link them to a comment AND highlight first but then have to leave a comment to save it
due date / goal date (figure out wording)

modals should be stretchaable.
merge todos so all their comments join together
-on edit page have a MERGE option and that pulls up a list of all todos on that project
edit comments


project level comments?
link pages? say you've got a copy of a page you're working on, create a list of linked pages on the project level where anything form one would save to the other.

Need an all option for page types...

Save collapsed vs open options in user settings for the project as a whole

When not in a course, pull up list of all courses where you have unresolved todos.
-save the last page you were working on in that course




LATER
Save named formattings for page so you can highlight text and apply it.
-IE grab a header and click header and it'll auto apply. Or grab a foot note and click foot note.

REALLY COOL: if we could somehow check what videos are playing, link a comment to a time stamp, and click a play button in the comment to play that video at that time.
