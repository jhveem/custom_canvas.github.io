Delet Projects
Page Specific Todos
-maybe have this be an option when selecting pages, quizzes, etc and it hides the others and sends the pageType and pageId to the server
--will need a way of storing and reading this, probably best way would be to still save pageType in pageTypes but then have a set aside value for the pageId that if it is not null, page id must match that
